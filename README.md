# CS320

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- As learned in CS320, software must be put through rigorous testing to ensure functionality and security. This semester, we leveraged technologies like junit testing to ensure that our code is up to industry standards. For each class, I made sure to bring my code up to full coverage to be able to mark the task as complete. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- User requirements must be adequately descriptive in order to prevent developing unwanted code. Personally, I ask clarifying questions where I feel necessary, and scrutinize my code as if it were not mine when deciding if requirements have been met or not. 

## How do I approach designing software?
- I use a design first, code later approach utilizing methods such as whiteboarding and writing pseudocode when writing software. I also will generate/collect requirements, refine them, then proceed to bring them to fruition. Throughout this process, I make sure to test my code and coninually test it throughout the development process to identify any regressions early.
